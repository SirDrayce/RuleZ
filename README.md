Basically, do not use ```.clearAnswer``` for numerical input.


## October 2019

Transferred RuleZ from Gist to GitHub (repositories).  
Benfits of transferring to this platform:

- Better navigation
- Better file managment
- Search
- Version control
- Collaboration
- Export repositories

If you have any inquiries, ask IT personnel via email.
